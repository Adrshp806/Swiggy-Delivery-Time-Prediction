The project is a regression problem that has input features about the rider, the vehicle
he owns, the weather condition, traffic and location of restaurant and delivery.
Goal: Predict the time in min to deliver the order from origin to destination.
Business Use Case:
In the competitive food delivery market, on-time delivery is critical for customer
satisfaction, retention, and operational efficiency. A company wants to optimize
delivery time predictions to improve customer experience by providing accurate
estimated delivery times (ETAs) and to manage resources effectively. Accurate
predictions of delivery time can also allow the business to:
Improve Delivery Efficiency: Identifying factors that slow down deliveries
enables better resource allocation, such as more reliable scheduling for
delivery personnel.
Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Reliable delivery ETAs can improve the
customer experience by reducing wait-time uncertainty.
Optimize Operational Costs: If the model can predict scenarios with higher
delays, additional resources (like more drivers or prioritizing specific orders)
can be allocated.
